Manjaro Linux Documentation
Installation Description 
The documentation focuses on the installation of Manjaro Linux in a virtual environment and explores the broader concept of virtualization in modern operating systems. The document outlines the step-by-step installation process using VirtualBox, highlights system requirements, discusses challenges faced during installation, and offers solutions. It also explains the advantages and disadvantages of Manjaro Linux and provides an in-depth overview of virtualization technologies, including hypervisors, containerization, and their implementation in various operating systems. The report serves as a practical and theoretical guide to understanding OS installation and virtualization in the context of system programming coursework.
System Call Description 
It provide a comprehensive overview of system calls in Manjaro Linux, specifically focusing on the listen() system call used in network programming. It explains system calls as the interface between user-space applications and the OS kernel, enabling tasks like file manipulation and network communication. The document details the syntax, parameters, and return values of listen(), and delves into its kernel-level implementation through functions like sys_listen, __sys_listen, and inet_listen. It also describes how the call transitions from user space to kernel space and how the socket is prepared to accept incoming connections. A complete C code example demonstrates how to implement a simple TCP server using listen() in Manjaro Linux.
